# University Clustering with K-Means

## Overview
This project applies **K-Means Clustering** to group universities based on various attributes. The goal is to identify clusters of similar universities based on their academic and financial metrics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- **Student Enrollment**
- **Graduation Rate**
- **Tuition Fees**
- **Acceptance Rate**
- **Faculty-to-Student Ratio**

## Clustering Algorithm: K-Means
- K-Means is an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm** used to group similar universities into clusters.
- The **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score** are used to determine the optimal number of clusters.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python (>= 3.7)
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

### Installation
Install the required dependencies:
```sh
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Getting Started
Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/University-Clustering-K-Means.git
cd University-Clustering-K-Means
```

### Running the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing and EDA**
   ```sh
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```
2. **Applying K-Means Clustering**
   ```sh
   python kmeans_clustering.py
   ```
3. **Visualizing the Results**
   ```sh
   python visualization.py
   ```

## Example Code
### Loading the Dataset
```python
import pandas as pd

data = pd.read_csv("data/universities.csv")
print(data.head())
```

### Applying K-Means
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(data)
labels = kmeans.labels_
```
